## How It Works

1. **Dataset Selection**: Choose between Redump and No-Intro
2. **Mode Selection**: Continue the queue or single-game download
3. **Platform Selection**: Dynamically fetched from the dataset root and filtered as you type (case-insensitive). CLI hints (name/code/number) still apply as initial filters.
4. **Queue Mode**: Reads your `download_queue` file and processes each game in order
5. **Single-Game Mode**: Enter a rough title for auto-match, or browse/search titles interactively
6. **Smart Search & Best Match**: Flexible matching and scoring with region/language preference
7. **Sequential Downloads**: Downloads one game at a time with progress bars
8. **Queue Management**: Automatically removes successfully downloaded games from the queue
9. **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs all operations for debugging

## Features

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Download from any supported Myrient archive
- **Dataset Toggle**: Redump and No-Intro root listings
- **Interactive Selection**: Fuzzy filtering for platforms and titles (type to narrow, number to pick)
- **Flexible Input**: Accept platform names, abbreviations, short codes (e.g., `PS2`, `X360`), or numbers
- **Archive Types**: Supports `.zip` and `.7z`
- **Single-Game Mode**: Enter a rough title or browse/search; prefers USA region when available
- **Smart Matching**: Multiple search patterns for better game discovery
- **Sequential Downloads**: Respectful to server with configurable delays
- **Resume Support**: Can resume interrupted downloads
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows download progress and overall completion status
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logs in `download_log.txt`
- **Queue Management**: Automatic cleanup of completed downloads
- **Error Handling**: Continues with next game if one fails

## Command Line Options

```bash
./universal_rom_downloader.sh [platform] [subtype]

Examples:
  ./universal_rom_downloader.sh                    # Interactive (choose queue or single game)
  ./universal_rom_downloader.sh PS2               # Start on PS2 (you'll still pick mode)
  ./universal_rom_downloader.sh "Xbox 360"         # Start on Xbox 360
  ./universal_rom_downloader.sh 9                 # Start on platform number 9
  ./universal_rom_downloader.sh --help            # Show help
```

## Configuration

Edit the script to modify:

- `MYRIENT_BASE_URL`: Base URL for Myrient archives
- `DOWNLOAD_DIR`: Where to save downloaded files
- `QUEUE_FILE`: Path to your download queue file
- `PLATFORMS`: Add/remove supported platforms
- Wait times between downloads (currently 3 seconds)

## Output

- **Downloads**: Saved to `./downloads/` directory
- **Logs**: Detailed logs in `download_log.txt`
- **Queue Updates**: Modified `download_queue` file with completed games removed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Archive Not Accessible**: Check internet connection and Myrient URL
2. **Games Not Found**: Some games may have different names in archives
3. **Download Failures**: Check log file for specific error messages
4. **Permission Errors**: Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x script.sh`)

### Manual Search

If a game isn't found automatically, manually search the Myrient archive at:
https://myrient.erista.me/files/Redump/
